## Welcome to ARwx repo.

I decided to reduce costs and simplify the content. You'll find a few key recommendations and important links. Our mission is to help everyone be more prepared and weather aware.

### Staying Informed
I recommend the following apps and services to stay informed about severe weather.

1. [Weather Radio](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00176T9OY/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_AC01DbA6128V6) - They cost about $30 and it could save your life. Plug in your location and it will wake you up if the NWS issues a watch or warning for your location. They are loud and annoying for a reason. If you don’t have time to wait for Amazon delivery check your local Kroger or Walmart. You’ll need to lookup your SAME code. Here is the [NWS SAME code list](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/coverage/ccov.php?State=AR) for Arkansas. I turn off everything other than Tornado Warning. When I hear that radio go off it's time to take cover.
2. [WeatherCall](https://weathercallservices.com/personal-use/) - Calls and text alerts for your precise home location. $10 a year
3. [WeatherUnderGround Mobile App](https://www.wunderground.com/download) - Reliable severe weather alerts.
4. [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/app) for iOS is free an has reliable alerts as well.

Please keep in mind that storms and **tornadoes can strike at night** when you are asleep. You need a system that will wake you up.

### Additional Weather Apps
1. [Radarscope](https://www.radarscope.app/) - THE professional weather radar app. Nothing else comes close.
2. [Hello Weather](https://helloweather.com/) - An excellent weather app with multiple sources an exemplary privacy policy. Lots of weather apps cell your location data. That's why I stopped using WeatherUnderground. Hello Weather does NOT have severe alerts at this time.

### Official Weather Links
-   [National Weather Service (NWS)](http://weather.gov/)

# Prep 101

If you start researching plans and tips for how to prepare for severe weather you’ll discover that it can be overwhelming. That’s why I decided to write Prep101. It’s intended to be a starter page for real people to help them be more weather aware and more prepared.
Be Aware of Severe Weather Events

First, you need some awareness of when severe weather is likely. Severe storms and tornadoes *should NOT* take you by surprise. The National Weather Service (NWS) and local meteorologists normally predict instability that may lead to storms anywhere from 1-4 days before the event. Tornado season comes twice a year, Spring and Fall, so if you see storms in the forecast tune in for details and timing. The NWS will issue a “Watch” which means the conditions are  favorable for severe weather. Simply interpreted it  means keep watch.

Secondly, you need loud blaring alerts when severe weather is imminent. A NWS “Warning” means bad stuff exists and is headed your way. You should be alerted for both severe weather watches and warning in your area.

## Have a Communications Plan

Storms have away for doing funny things to the systems that we take for granted. (cellular, power, our minds). This is not a throw away step, it’s important.

- Establish an Out-of-Town Contact (OOC) – Phone systems might be able to route you out-of-region easier than in town. Pick a friend or family member that you all agree to call if severe weather strikes and you are separated and can’t get in touch with your immediate family. Use this out OOC as a relay and check-in to know everyone is safe.
- Remember to try texting – SMS takes very little data and may work even if calls don’t.
- Write down numbers – If you dropped your phone while running to shelter do you know the number of your spouse? OOC? Kid’s school? As you make this plan, write it down on a contact card and keep it in a purse or wallet.
- Use Ready.gov‘s great resources like the [Family Communication Plan Builder](https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1440449346150-1ff18127345615d8b7e1effb4752b668/Family_Comm_Plan_508_20150820.pdf) and more.

## Build a Kit

I’ll link to 2 excellent lists that will guide you to building an extensive kit. The truth is I don’t have all this and since we are just taking steps to get started here is what is in my bag:

- Flashlights
- Emergency Ponchos
- Trash bags
- Water Bottles
- Printed copies of Family Plan, contacts, and a little cash
- Toiletries (toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorant) in case we aren’t able to return home for a few days.
- First Aid Kit
- Phone charger
- Multitool and folding knife

Here are the full lists to take you even further:

## Beyond the Basics

These are few recommendations that I’ve gathered and developed over the years. I think they make good sense.

1. No Flip-Flops Allowed – If you take shelter even in home be wearing decent shoes. You might have to walk out of that spot over splintered wood and nails so either wear good shoes or keep some old tennis shoes in your kit. (Don’t forget about kid’s shoes as well.)
2. Helmets on Kids – Put the kids in helmets. Baseball, football, bike… whatever you have. Heads are important and this is a good way to keep them safe.
3. Whistles on Necks – If I’m trapped under debris I’d rather not have to yell for hours hoping my voice holds out. Give every member a whistle and hang it around their neck. Personally I like my $6 Storm Whistle and my daughter does too. It’s loud and if anyone is within a few hundred yards they will hear me.
4. Save a local copy of your Family plan to your iPhone – I have a family plan that includes contact info, utility contacts, insurance contacts and account numbers, family info etc and you should as well. I have most of this info in Evernote but I always like having a copy saved directly to my iPhone. I email the PDF to myself and then open the PDF and save it to iBooks. Great way to have a local copy that works in airplane mode every time.
5. Roleplay and practice – Just like a fire drill, practice reduces panic and fear. I role play with the kids and make it into a little game. Then when we are sheltering at 2am they aren’t usually freaked out.
