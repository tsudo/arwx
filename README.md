## Staying Informed

To stay informed about severe weather in Tornado Alley, it's critical to have reliable tools and sources. Here are my top recommendations.

### Essential Resources

I highly recommend these 3 tools for anyone living in areas prone to tornadoes:

1. **[Weather Radio](https://a.co/d/6sKr92p)** - Midland weather radios range from $30-$75 and are crucial for your safety. They are designed to be loud and can wake you up with alerts for your area (such as watches or warnings issued by the NWS). (I personally only allow Tornado Warning alerts on my radio, I don't want to become complacent to alert sound.) If immediate delivery is needed, check local stores like Kroger or Walmart. Remember to find your SAME code using this [NWS SAME code list](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/coverage/ccov.php?State=AR).

2. **[WeatherCall](https://weathercallservices.com/personal-use/)** - This service offers calls and text alerts for a precise location for only $10-$12 a year. Ensure it's added to your phone's sleep mode settings so that you can receive calls at night.

3. **[Radarscope](https://www.radarscope.app/)** - Radarscope is the go-to professional weather radar app. It's the only radar app I trust for accurate and timely data.

### Weather Apps & Alerts

Be cautious with weather apps as many, including well-known ones, monetize by selling user data. Always read the privacy policy before downloading any weather app.

- **[Hello Weather App](https://helloweather.com/)** - Unlike most weather apps that are complex and intrusive, Hello Weather offers a user-friendly interface and privacy-friendly options. Note, it does NOT include push notifications, but the default system notifications on iOS are generally sufficient.

### Additional Alert Apps

For other reliable alerting apps, consider:

- **[FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/about/news-multimedia/mobile-products#download)** - Known for swift mobile app notifications, FEMA also provides valuable planning and recovery resources.
  
- **[Red Cross Emergency App](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/mobile-apps.html)** - Available for both iOS and Android, this app allows you to set alert locations for friends and family, enhancing your preparedness.

Storms and **tornadoes can strike at night**, hence having a system that can wake you up is crucial.

## Prep 101

Preparing for severe weather can seem daunting, but starting with basic awareness and preparedness can significantly enhance your safety.

### Awareness

- **Weather Alerts**: Keep an eye on the forecast during tornado seasons in spring and fall. The NWS issues "Watches" when conditions are favorable for severe weather, which means it's time to stay alert.

### Communication Plan

Power outages and cellular disruptions can happen during severe storms. Here’s how to stay connected:

- **Out-of-Town Contact**: Designate a friend or family member outside your area as your primary contact to relay information.
- **Texting**: SMS messages are more likely to go through when calls fail. Ensure you know how to send texts if iMessages don't deliver.
- **Written Contacts**: Keep a written list of important phone numbers in case your phone is lost or damaged.

### Emergency Kit

Start with these essentials:

- Flashlights, emergency ponchos, trash bags, water bottles.
- Printed copies of your family plan and contact numbers.
- Basic toiletries and a first aid kit.
- Phone charger and a multitool.

## Advanced Tips

- **Proper Footwear**: Always wear sturdy shoes even if taking shelter at home.
- **Helmets for Kids**: Protect their heads with any helmet available.
- **Whistles**: Equip each family member with a whistle for emergency signaling.
- **Save Important Documents Locally**: Keep digital copies of important documents on your devices, accessible even offline.
- **Practice Drills**: Conduct regular drills to reduce panic and ensure everyone knows what to do.
